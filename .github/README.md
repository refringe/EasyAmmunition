This is a mod for Single Player Tarkov.  
https://www.sp-tarkov.com

This mod is a streamlined server-side adaptation inspired by [Faupi - Munitions Expert](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/554-faupi-munitions-expert/)​. The core concept of this mod is to assign background colours to ammunition items based on their penetration values. By focusing solely on this feature, and writing unique code for it, the mod avoids the need for additional client-side alterations. Additionally, this minimalist approach ensures that the mod remains compatible with SPT for longer without requiring updates every time the game client is updated.
