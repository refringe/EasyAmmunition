This is a mod for Single Player Tarkov.  
https://www.sp-tarkov.com

Adjust the background colours of ammunition based on their penetration values to make them easier to identify at a glance. This is a simple server-based modification inspired by the [Faupi - Munitions Expert](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/554-faupi-munitions-expert/) mod, and how it handles background colours. Because this version of the mod doesn't include any of the client-side code, it's a much easier to maintain as SPT updates are released.
