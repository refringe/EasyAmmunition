# Easy Ammunition

This is a mod for [Single Player Tarkov](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/).

Assign background colours to ammunition items based on their penetration values. This allows players to quickly identify the best ammunition without having a PHD in ammunition engineering. This mod is a streamlined server-side adaptation of [Faupi - Munitions Expert](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/554-faupi-munitions-expert/)â€‹.

This mod is compatible with [Color Converter API](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1509-color-converter-api/). This server-side mod will allow you to use hex colour codes to assign background colours. It's highly recommended, but not required.
