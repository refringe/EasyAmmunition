    // This mod also supports the "Color Converter API" by RaiRaiTheRaichu. This additional client side mod is used to
    // allow HEX colour values to be used as background colours. Once you have this installed, you can use any HEX
    // colour value you'd like.

    // If you do not have the Color Converter API installed, only the "high" colour will be used. If you have it
    // installed, the "low" colour will be used as well, and the ammo background colour will be a shade between the two
    // depending on the exact penetration value.
