# Realism Configuration File

Only the file named `config.json5` is loaded. If you prefer to use the realism colour configuration, you can delete the default `config.json5` file and rename the `realism.json5` file to `config.json5`.

The `json5` file extension is not a mistake. __*Do not change it!*__

Have fun!
